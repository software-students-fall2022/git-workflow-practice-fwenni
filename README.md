[From Code to Cure: Engineering Genomics](https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/06/from-code-to-cure-engineering-genomics/)<br/>
This is an article about using computer science to deliver personalized diagnosis and treatment on a genomic level. The author mentioned Vinod Khosla, who said that computer scientists, and not biologists, will be the ones who ultimately disrupt the way medicine is practiced. I found this quote very interesting.
